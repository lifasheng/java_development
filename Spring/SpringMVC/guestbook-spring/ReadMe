1. Intellij Community version + Tomcat + Maven

2. Source code is downloaded from https://www.objectdb.com/tutorial/jpa/intellij/spring/maven

3. After downloaded, import to Intellij by following: File => New => Project from existing sources

4. Following https://stefancosma.xyz/2018/10/01/how-to-use-tomcat-intellij-idea-community/ to setup tomcat:
4.1 Tomcat Configuration

    Make sure you install Tomcat in your mac, just download it and uncompressed it.
    like download apache-tomcat-8.5.35-src.tar.gz, and uncompress it to:
    /Users/xxx/Documents/servlet_software/apache-tomcat-8.5.35


    After that, in mac, IntellijIDEA => Preferences => expand Tools and select External Tools

    You can add a new tool with whatever name you want. I named mine as 'Tomcat'.
    For tool settings, select the catalina.bat file, usually located in the bin folder of your Tomcat installation.
    For example '~/Documents/servlet_software/apache-tomcat-8.5.35/bin/catalina.sh'

    And last but not least set an argument with the command 'jpda run'.
    The working directory should be set automatically.
4.2 Start Tomcat
    If you go to Tools -> External Tools and click on Tomcat, it should start the Tomcat server.

4.3 Maven Build And Deploy To Tomcat
    Now that you're done with the Tomcat configuration you want the ability to build
    using Maven and deploy to the now working Tomcat server.

    To achieve this you'll need to head over to Run -> Edit Configurations, click the "+" and select Maven.
    Don't forget to name your new configuration, like 'deployMavenToTomcat'. Select your project location and add the following command line.

    compile war:war org.codehaus.mojo:wagon-maven-plugin:upload-single -Dwagon.fromFile=/Users/xxx/work/java_development/Spring/SpringMVC/guestbook-spring/target/GuestBook.war -Dwagon.url=file:/Users/xxx/Documents/servlet_software/apache-tomcat-8.5.35/webapps
    What this line does is that it builds the project, using Maven,
    and then gets the file from the specified path (that's usually configured in your project) and copies it to the webapps folder in Tomcat.
    Tomcat then knows it has a new version of the file and redeploys it.

6. Tomcat Remote Debug
   To achieve this you'll need to add a new configuration like the previous step.
   The only difference this time is that when you click "+" you'll need to select Remote.

   Give your configuration a name. You'll need to set the Debugger mode to Attach to remote JVM,
   the Transport to Socket, the Host to localhost and lastly the Port to 8000.
   That way when you start the configuration, Intellij will connect via Socket to the Tomcat server that emits via port 8000.
   You can change the port for Tomcat, to something else, in the Tomcat server.xml file, in the config folder.


   Tomcat Remote Debug
   Once the Tomcat server is started you can run this configuration. Just click on Run -> Debug
   and then select the newly created configuration.

   If you want to keep a record of all the logs when debugging,
   you can achieve this by going to the Logs tabs in the newly created Remote configuration
   and set the Save console output to file to the logs folder of your Tomcat installation.
