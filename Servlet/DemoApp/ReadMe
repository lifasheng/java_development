This is a demo project which is used to practice Servlet/JSP.

I just follow Youtube video: Servlet and JSP Tutorial for Beginners 2018

This series of videos are easy to follow and I can start to try my idea quickly, thanks to the author :-)

DemoApp is pure Servlet/JSP project, it needs the Servers project to run locally in my eclipse.

So far I just use eclipse, Tomcat, Tomcat source code.

Please check the video to see how to setup the Eclipse dev env and how to install Tomcat server and source code!
