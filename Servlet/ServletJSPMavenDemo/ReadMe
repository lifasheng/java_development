This is a demo project which is used to practice Servlet/JSP.

I just follow Youtube video: Servlet and JSP Tutorial for Beginners 2018

This series of videos are easy to follow and I can start to try my idea quickly, thanks to the author :-)

This ServletJSPMavenDemo is using Maven to manage the dependencies, it also needs the Servers project to run locally in my eclipse.

So far I just use eclipse, Tomcat, Tomcat source code, mysql.
For how to install mysql locally, please refer to java_development/Spring/Spring4Hibernate4/ReadMe.


Note that we should add Apache Tomcat to the Libraries directory:
1. On left 'Project Explorer', select the project name: ServletJSPMavenDemo
2. right click and select 'Properties'
3. Choose 'Targeted Runtime', select 'Apache Tomcat v8.5'.

Please check the video to see how to setup the Eclipse dev env and how to install Tomcat server and source code!
