This is a demo project which is used to practice Servlet/JSP.

I just follow Youtube video: Servlet and JSP Tutorial for Beginners 2018

This series of videos are easy to follow and I can start to try my idea quickly, thanks to the author :-)

This ServletJSPMavenDemo is using Maven to manage the dependencies, it also needs the Servers project to run locally in my eclipse.

So far I just use eclipse, Tomcat, Tomcat source code, mysql.
For how to install mysql locally, please refer to java_development/Spring/Spring4Hibernate4/ReadMe.
